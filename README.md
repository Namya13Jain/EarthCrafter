# Problem Statement
Many individuals are willing to contribute to charitable causes and support environmental sustainability but face barriers in finding convenient avenues for donations and accessing products that align with these values. There's a lack of user-friendly platforms that seamlessly facilitate doorstep collection of donations, hindering the process of making a positive impact on both charitable initiatives and the environment. Additionally, supporting goshalas and their products like milk and agarbattis often lacks a dedicated, accessible online marketplace. These gaps highlight the need for a comprehensive solution that simplifies the donation process, encourages philanthropic actions, and offers a convenient way to support goshalas and environmentally friendly products.

# Solution
Earth Crafter is an all-in-one platform focused on facilitating charitable donations and supporting environmentally friendly practices.

1. **Doorstep Collection Scheduling**: The app provides a user-friendly interface that allows individuals to easily schedule pickups for donations of food and clothes. Users can select a convenient time for collection, making it hassle-free to contribute to charitable causes.
 
2. **Hassle-Free Donations**: By enabling donations directly from users' doorsteps, the app streamlines the process of making a positive impact on the environment. This convenience encourages more people to participate in charitable activities without any added stress or inconvenience.
   
3. **Cowtopia**: It is an online marketplace offering various products like milk, agarbattis (incense sticks), and potentially more, aimed at supporting goshalas (cow shelters). Users can purchase these products, knowing that their contributions are helping to support and sustain these shelters.
